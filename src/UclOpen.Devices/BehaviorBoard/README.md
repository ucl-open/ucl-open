# Harp Behavior Interface
This module interfaces and configures a [Harp Behavior](https://github.com/harp-tech/device.behavior) device, developed by [HARP Tech](https://harp.tech/).

## Bonsai Workflow
This workflow establishes basic communication between your workflow and the device. Further functionality, such as triggering cameras, or a solenoid valve, can be found in other, standalone workflows in this, `utilities` section of this repository.

## Properties
The properties of this workflow allow the user to configure the basic device parameters and set the name of shared `Subjects` to either publish or subscribe to as an interface between your broader Bonsai workflow and a behavior board. 
## Device Features
The [behavior board](https://github.com/harp-tech/device.behavior) is a highly capable device in the Harp ecosystem with multiple features and functions.  

- **Digital outputs** (DO0–DO3) with PWM up to 10 kHz  
- **RGB LED and standard LED control** (via flick‑lock and screw terminals)  
- **Valve actuation and poke detection** through RJ45 ports  
- **Servo and camera control** (2 each)  
- **Quadrature counter** (on Port 2)  
- **ADC input** (5 V analog)  
- **Clock sync input** and USB serial communication  
For full hardware specs and configuration details, see the [official repository](https://github.com/harp-tech/device.behavior).

### Input and Output `Subjects`
