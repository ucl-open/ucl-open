"""References from a rig configuration to files in its configuration directory.

A rig configuration names the calibration artefacts it uses on the devices they calibrate,
never in a central index, so the platform stays agnostic of what hardware a rig has. Tooling
that needs every reference (a deployment check, a startup check, a session snapshot) finds
them with `rig_artefacts` instead.
